3. Connect to GitHub using GitHub authentication.
4. Use built-in **Git tools** in VS:
- **Commit**: Save code changes locally.
- **Push**: Upload commits to GitHub.
- **Pull**: Sync changes from GitHub to local.
5. Auto-push with every code improvement.

## 🚧 Version History and Security Enhancements

### 🔓 Version 1 – Initial Insecure Code
- Direct SQL queries (no prepared statements)
- File uploads lack extension/mime-type checks
- No session timeout or CSRF protection
- User input is not sanitized (prone to XSS)
- Plaintext password storage (no hashing)

✅ *Committed as `v1-insecure`*

---

### 🔐 Version 2 – Basic Security Fixes
- Implemented **password hashing** with `password_hash()`
- Replaced SQL queries with **prepared statements**
- Basic input sanitization using `htmlspecialchars()`

✅ *Committed as `v2-hashed-sql-secure`*

---

### 🛡️ Version 3 – Intermediate Hardening
- Added **MIME type validation** to `upload.php`
- Enforced file extension whitelist (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`)
- Set **secure session flags** and timeout logic
- Disabled PHP errors from displaying in production

✅ *Committed as `v3-file-validation-session-fix`*

---

### 🧪 Version 4 – Penetration Testing & Final Fixes
- Conducted manual penetration testing using tools:
- `Burp Suite` for XSS and CSRF detection
- `OWASP ZAP` for scanning known vulns
- Added **CSRF tokens** to all forms
- Implemented strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Enabled **output escaping** and **HTTP-only cookies**

✅ *Committed as `v4-final-hardened`*

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment Process

1. Develop ➡️ Test ➡️ Fix ➡️ Commit ➡️ Push ➡️ Review
2. Maintain version history and logs in commit messages
3. All security updates are documented step-by-step in this file
4. GitHub Actions (optional) can be used to trigger tests on push
